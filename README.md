# Character Style Shaper Fuse for Blackmagic Fusion
## Features
This Fuse will generate an independent Text+ node. The new Text+ node is already filled with data, which was given by the spline and presets of the Fuse. Each Character receives its unique value which influences the Shape of the complete Line of the Text.
