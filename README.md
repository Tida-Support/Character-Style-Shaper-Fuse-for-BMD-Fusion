# Character Style Shaper Fuse for Blackmagic Fusion
## Features
This Fuse will generate an independent Text+ node. The new Text+ node is already filled with data, which was calculated by this Fuse. Each Character of the Text becomes its unique value which influences the Shape of the complete Line of the Text.
